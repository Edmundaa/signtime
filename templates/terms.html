<ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0; margin-left: 50px;">

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <strong style="color: #007BFF;">Dominant hand:</strong> A signer’s stronger hand, usually their writing hand. One-handed signs are made with the dominant hand. In two-handed signs where the handshapes differ, the dominant hand often has a more complex handshape or movement.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <strong style="color: #007BFF;">Fingerspelling:</strong> This sign includes one or more letters of the fingerspelling alphabet. See alphabet tab.

    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <strong style="color: #007BFF;">Inflection: pluralisation:</strong> The movement of this sign can be repeated to show that there is more than one thing, animal or person.

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <strong style="color: #007BFF;">Informal:</strong> These colloquial signs are mainly used in informal situations, usually between signers who know each other well.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <strong style="color: #007BFF;">Mouth pattern:</strong> Many signs, especially nouns and verbs, can be accompanied by silent mouthing of a spoken word that corresponds to the sign meaning. Some signs are formed with specific movements of the lips, tongue and mouth that are not related to speech, but contribute to the meaning of the sign.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <strong style="color: #007BFF;">Neologism:</strong> Neologisms are signs that have only recently come into use and may not be known by the whole NZSL community. Many neologisms have developed in educational settings.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <strong style="color: #007BFF;">Non-dominant hand:</strong> The signer’s weaker hand, usually their non-writing hand. In two-handed signs where the handshapes differ, the non-dominant hand usually has a less complex handshape and movement than the dominant hand.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <strong style="color: #007BFF;">Non-manual signals:</strong> Movements of the eyebrows, eyes, mouth, cheeks, head and upper body that add grammatical meaning to a sign or phrase.

    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <strong style="color: #007BFF;">Number incorporation:</strong> The handshape of this sign can be changed to a number handshape (usually from 1-5, occasionally from 1-9) to show how many items or people are involved. See numbers tab.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <strong style="color: #007BFF;">Obscene:</strong> These signs could be considered rude (for example because they are a swear word or have sexual reference).
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <strong style="color: #007BFF;">One or two handed:</strong> This sign can be produced either with one hand or with both hands. In some two-handed signs, the non-dominant hand is commonly dropped (especially when it is a base handshape that does not move), to produce a one-handed form. Some one-handed signs may be duplicated on the non-dominant hand.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <strong style="color: #007BFF;">Person agreement:</strong> The movement of this (verb) sign can be directed to different locations in the signing space to show who is carrying out an action and who is the recipient.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
        <strong style="color: #007BFF;">Rare:</strong> Some signs are used rarely, or only by a small proportion of NZSL users, because another variant has become more popular.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
